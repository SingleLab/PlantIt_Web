                <strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong> Since PlantIt stores your data locally on your device 
                and does not require personal information, there is minimal information to share. We may share information only 
                in the following limited circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Only when you explicitly choose to share information (e.g., exporting your plant data)</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> If you opt in to anonymous usage statistics, this data may be processed by analytics services to help us improve the app. This data is fully anonymized and cannot be linked to you or your device.</li>

        </section>

        <section id="data-security">
            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                Your privacy and security are our top priorities. Since PlantIt stores your data locally on your device 
                and does not require you to send personal information to our servers, your data remains under your control.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your plant data, photos, and notes are stored securely on your device</li>
                <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You can use the app without creating an account or sharing personal information</li>
                <li><strong>Optional Encryption:</strong> If you use the optional sync feature, data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Data Collection:</strong> We only collect anonymous usage statistics that cannot identify you</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We encourage you to keep your device secure 
                and use device-level security features like passwords or biometric authentication.
            </p>

        <section id="data-retention">
            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                Since PlantIt stores your data locally on your device, you have complete control over your data retention. 
                Your plant records, photos, and notes remain on your device until you choose to delete them. We do not 
                store your personal plant data on our servers unless you opt to use the optional sync feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you use the optional sync feature and create an account, your synced data will be retained until you 
                delete your account or remove specific data. You can delete your account and all associated data at any 
                time through the app settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anonymous usage statistics are retained for analytical purposes but cannot be linked to you personally.

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                PlantIt is safe for users of all ages. Since the app does not require account creation, does not collect 
                personal information, and stores all data locally on the device, it can be safely used by children under 
                the supervision of parents or guardians. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. 
                If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of the app, please contact us.

            <h2>9. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
            <p>
                PlantIt is designed to work offline and does not require internet connectivity or access to third-party services 
                for its core functionality. However, if you choose to use optional features such as exporting data or accessing 
                help documentation, you may encounter links to external resources. We are not responsible for the privacy practices 
                of any external websites or services you choose to visit.

            <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Since PlantIt stores your data locally on your device by default, there are no international data transfers 
                for the core app functionality. However, if you choose to use the optional sync feature and create an account, 
                your encrypted data may be stored on servers that could be located outside of your country. Data stored on 
                sync servers is encrypted and you can delete it at any time. By opting to use the sync feature, you consent 
                to this optional transfer of your encrypted data.
